# FACE INSTRUMENT

oF Final Project:
This project originated out of the following questions: could we make sound with our face? What if our expressions were musical? What kinds of sound would be tied to each facial feature? 

Using ofxFaceTracker addon, ofxCV, and Sound in Open Frameworks, I am enabling a movement in each facial feature to create a unique sound. 

For example, when your mouth is opened wide, African drum beats are turned on. When smiled, it creates a tingly harp sound. When eyes are opend wide, cymbal is played, and when nostrils are flare, a gong rings. 

By moving your face in dynamic ways, you can create different compositions of music.
